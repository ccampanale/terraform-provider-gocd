Terraform provider for GoCD Server

## Installation

    $ brew tap beamly/tap
    $ brew install terraform-provider-gocd
    $ tf-install-provider gocd

__NOTE__: `terraform` does not currently provide a way to easily install 3rd party providers. Until this is implemented,
the `tf-install-provider` utility can be used to copy the provider binary to the correct location.

__NOTE__: Given the requirements by hashicorp for SLA's to be set for importing providers into the `hashicorp-provider` github organisation, and as I am but one person on this, there's little chance this will become an officially sanctioned terraform provider. See [Terraform Provider Development Program](https://www.terraform.io/guides/terraform-provider-development-program.html):

> The expectation is to resolve all critical issues within 48 hours and all other issues within 5 business days.

## Development Setup

Get project and install dependencies using glide:

    $ go get github.com/beamly/terraform-provider-gocd
    $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/beamly/terraform-provider-gocd/

Then you can run tests as follows:

    $ make testacc

## Demo

You will need docker and terraform >= 0.10.0 installed for this demo to work.

Either build the provider with `go build` or download it from the gihub repository. If you download it, make sure the binary is in the current folder.

	$ go build

Spin up the test gocd server, with endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:8153/go/

    $ make provision-test-gocd && sh ./scripts/wait-for-test-server.sh

Then initialise and apply the configuration.

    $ terraform init
    $ terraform apply

When you're finished, run:

    $ make teardown-test-gocd
